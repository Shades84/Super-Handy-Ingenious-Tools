# Super Handy Ingenious Tools
Some Rainmeter skins that have niche but handy functions. Mostly made this for fun

This repo includes a
* shutdown immediately button
* delayed shutdown with cancel function
* turn off monitor
* toggle monitor configuration (see below)
* toggle skin Z position

## Toggle Monitor Configuration
If you have multiple monitors and use [DisplayFusion](https://www.displayfusion.com/) you can configure it in such a way that you can disable some of your screens (or all, I guess). This means you can set a productivity configuration with all the monitors on then switch to a cinema configuration where only a main display is on. 

This means creating two ["Monitor Profiles"](https://www.displayfusion.com/Features/MonitorConfig/) then setting shortcuts to them. In this repo, I have included 2 AutoHotKey scripts to fire "Alt-F23" and "Alt-F24" which are configured to one of those profiles each. (I've included the compiled executable in case you don't have AutoHotKey)

The next (much easier) step is to configure 2 Rainmeter layouts; one for each Monitor Profile. ([Here] (https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/user-interface/manage/#LayoutsTab) if you need it)

Edit the skin to have the correct layout names. If things aren't working, it's probably a string problem.

## Toggle Skin Z position
I rarely have no windows open, so I never see my visualizer. With this skin, you can toggle the Z position of a visualizer (or any skin) with one click. Edit the skin to have the correct skin name
